        <h4>Absorptive Removal of chromium from Aqueous phase using treated sawdust. (July
            2018-June 2019)</h4>
        <p>We removed chromium ions from aqueous phase (A synthetic Chromium solution made with
            K2Cr2O7 dissolved in 1 litre water) using treated sawdust. Sawdust was converted into
            charcoal by specific processes as follows:-</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Carbonization: Cleaned sawdust is passed through a sieve and heated in a furnace
                (covered) at 500 degrees Celsius for 90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Activation: Resultant charcoal is taken and activated with concentrated H2SO4 and
                Na2CO3. After that we put the mixture into the furnace for 30 minutes for 600 degrees
                Celsius.
            </li>
            <li>Neutralization: The resultant activated charcoal was taken out of furnace and
                neutralized with a dilute NaOH solution and dried in hot air oven
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> With this activated carbon we have done studies like Adsorption Isotherms, effect of
            pH, kinetic studies and change of concentration with adsorbent dosage and made following
            conclusions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Follows both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms</li>
            <li> Adsorption increases with decrease in pH.</li>
            <li> Follows both pseudo 1st and 2nd order characteristics</li>
